This documentation relates to the OS tool - OSINT Burned Area Tracker. The tool has been created for researchers, investigators, and journalists to study areas which have been impacted by fires or the destruction of lands. 

While true color imagery (images of buildings or forests in their natural color) are widely used in open-source investigations, there is opportunity to use remote sensing data for more detailed investigation. 




## Using Sentinel-2 to track burned areas

The application imports data from [Sentinel-2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2), a collection available on Google Earth Engine. 


## What is a "Before" and "After" collection?

## How do we remove bodies of water from the map?

## How do we account for cloud images?

## How accurate is this map and calculation?
