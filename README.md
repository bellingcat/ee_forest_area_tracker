This documentation relates to the OS tool - OSINT Burned Area Tracker. The tool has been created for researchers, investigators, and journalists to study areas which have been impacted by fires or the destruction of lands. 

While true color imagery (images of buildings or forests in their natural color) are widely used in open-source investigations, there is opportunity to use remote sensing data for more detailed investigation. 

With Google Earth Engine, investigators can make use of satellites' remote sensing data to study specific characteristic, such as vegatation, temperature, and changes in the built environment. 

The OSINT Burned Area Tracker uses specific parameters that reveal the extent of burned areas. The tool was initially created to study the impact of Russia's invasion on Ukraine and its environmental impact, but it can be applied to any region around the world (you just have to know the coordinates!).

### Using Sentinel-2 to track burned areas

The application imports data from [Sentinel-2](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2), a collection available on Google Earth Engine.
